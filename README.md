# Classify images of cats and dogs 

# Overview:
This project involves the implementation of a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify images of cats and dogs. The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle and consists of labeled images of cats and dogs for training and testing.

# Dataset:
The dataset can be found on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data

# Model used:
Support Vector Machine (SVM) is employed for image classification. SVM is a supervised learning algorithm that can be used for both classification and regression tasks. In the context of image classification, SVM aims to find the optimal hyperplane that separates different classes in the feature space.
